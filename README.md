# weather-dashboard

In this assignment we had to create a weather dashboard that included the forecast for different city's.

## Functionality

In the application we needed:

- A search bar for the city.

- Storage of recently searched city's
- A display of todays forecast with Temp, Wind, Humidity, and UV index.
- The UV index changes colors depending on the number.
- Below the display of today it gives you a 5 day forecast with a weather icon, date, temp, wind, and humidity.
- The icons change with the current weather situation.
